This compounds table serves as a central reference for storing metadata about various chemical compounds used in this project. Each row represents a unique compound, including key identifying information and essential molecular properties.

This table is particularly useful for linking compound metadata with raw data extracted from structure data files (SDFs) and for facilitating downstream analysis such as filtering by molecular weight, mapping assay results, or cross referencing experimental data blocks.

Below the atoms table is displayed, and designed to capture atomic level information for each compound in the dataset. It serves as a detailed structural breakdown, storing the elemental identity and 3D spatial coordinates of every atom present in the compounds.

This data enables molecular modeling, 3D visualization, and geometric analysis supporting tasks such as identifying key regions, analyzing spatial arragment, or performing computational simulations.
